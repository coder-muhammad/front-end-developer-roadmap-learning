# Phase 4: React.js Mastery

In this phase, I will learn **React.js**, one of the most popular front-end frameworks. React allows me to build interactive and component-based UIs, and manage application state efficiently.

---

## Learning Goals:
- Understand **React components**, props, and state.
- Learn **React hooks** like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.
- Master **React Router** for routing in single-page applications (SPA).
- Learn **state management** with Context API or Redux.

---

## Key Concepts:
- **React Basics**: Components, JSX, props, state.
- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`.
- **React Router**: Navigating between pages in a React app.
- **State Management**: Context API or Redux.

---

## Project:
- **Multi-page Blog or E-commerce Site**: A full-fledged React application that utilizes React Router for navigation and handles state using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. It will fetch data from an API and display it dynamically.
