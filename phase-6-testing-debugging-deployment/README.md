# Phase 6: Testing, Debugging, and Deployment

In this phase, I will learn how to **test** my code, **debug** issues, and deploy my web apps to production. Iâ€™ll also focus on optimizing the performance and improving SEO.

---

## Learning Goals:
- Learn **unit testing** with Jest and **end-to-end testing** with Cypress.
- Use **debugging tools** to troubleshoot and fix issues in code.
- **Deploy applications** to platforms like Netlify or Vercel.

---

## Key Concepts:
- **Unit Testing**: Using Jest for testing JavaScript code.
- **End-to-End Testing**: Using Cypress for UI testing.
- **Debugging**: Using Chrome DevTools and React DevTools.
- **Deployment**: Deploying to Netlify or Vercel.

---

## Project:
- **Deploy a React app**: A React application with optimizations for performance (lazy loading, minification) and SEO (meta tags, alt text, etc.).
