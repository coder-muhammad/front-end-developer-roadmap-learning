# Phase 3: Intermediate JavaScript â€“ Practical Interactivity

In this phase, I will dive deeper into **asynchronous JavaScript**, **AJAX**, and advanced **DOM manipulation** techniques. This phase will prepare me for building more interactive and dynamic web applications.

---

## Learning Goals:
- Understand **asynchronous JavaScript** with callbacks, promises, and async/await.
- Learn how to interact with external data using **AJAX** and **fetch** API.
- Master **advanced DOM manipulation** for dynamic web pages.
- Handle user input and implement **form validation** with JavaScript.

---

## Key Concepts:
- **Asynchronous JavaScript**: Callbacks, promises, async/await.
- **AJAX**: Using `fetch()` to retrieve data from APIs.
- **DOM Manipulation**: Creating interactive elements like modals, dropdowns, and accordions.
- **Form Validation**: Client-side form validation using JavaScript.

---

## Project:
- **Weather App**: An app that fetches weather data from an external API and dynamically updates the DOM with the weather forecast for a selected city.
